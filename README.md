# Reinforcement_learning
RL repo for my personal learning process for the Sutton Book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" together with project implementing game AI using Deep Q learning, Double Q learning and Dueling DQN.


This repo records the agent, DQN for snake game and flappy bird, saved training curve and model checkpoint for best reward.
